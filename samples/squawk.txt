The Squawk Demo package
=======================


Step 1 - Install the 1.3 or later JVM from Sun
----------------------------------------------

This is available for download from http://java.sun.com/j2se/



Step 2 - Set up the environment for the embedded JVM
----------------------------------------------------


The environment must be configured appropriately for the C version of Squawk
to work. (This is because the C version uses an embedded JVM for its graphical
output.)

A program is available that should tell you what command to enter. To run
this program enter the following command:

    java -cp squawk.jar jvmenv

The output of this tool will either be a command which you should be able to
simply cut and paste onto the command line or a description of the steps you
need to take manually to configure the environment.


Step 3 - Run a demo program
---------------------------

Squawk can be run as a Java application running under another JVM, or as a
standalone application.

The Java Squawk can be run:

    java -jar squawk.jar -Ximage:squawk.image <Name of class>

The C Squawk can be run:

    squawk -Xcp:squawk.jar -Ximage:squawk.image <Name of class>


The Java version is only really of interest if the supplied x86 executable
is not applicatable for your computer. The Java version was made to debug
the VM and is many times slower than the production C code.

The following programs are in the demo image:

    example.chess.Main              - A Chess program that plays both sides


    example.mpeg.Main               - An MPEG-1 decoder


    example.cubes.Main              - A rotating cubes virtual reality program
                                        (use arrow keys).

    example.spaceinv.Main           - Space invaders
                                        (use arrow keys and enter).

    example.manyballs.Main          - Balls bouncing around the screen
                                        (use arrow keys).

    example.pong.Main               - The game of Pong
                                        (use arrow keys).

    example.wormgame.Main           - A great invertebrate experence
                                        (use arrow keys).


Combine one of these class names with one of the execution commands above

e.g:
    java -jar squawk.jar -Ximage:squawk.image example.chess.Main
or:
    squawk -Xcp:squawk.jar -Ximage:squawk.image example.mpeg.Main


Why is the exe so small?
------------------------


Why is the image so big?
------------------------

The image file is a model of all the memory needed for the VM to run. It
includes provision for a ROM an EEPROM and a RAM. The image supplied here
contains a fully functional CLDC runtime library a graphics library and
the demo programs listed above. All of these items are placed in the ROM
part of the image. The EEPROM part is not used in the demo image, but the
RAM part is built to be 4MB in size to accomidate the large memory
requirement for the MPEG-1 decoder.
