Contains classes for debug information. The back end generates debug information
as a side effect of code generation. Debug information includes a mapping of
program counter offsets to bytecode indices as well as pointer maps, specifying
the stack location of all pointers for all positions where garbage collection
can occur.<p>

An instance of the class {@link javac1.backend.debug.OffsetDesc} stores the offsets
of various entry points in the machine code. The {@link javac1.backend.code.CodeEmitter}
assigns the correct values to the fields as soon as the corresponding code is
generated.
