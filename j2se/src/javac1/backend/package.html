Provides classes for the back end of the compiler. The back end is responsible
for register allocation and code generation. It iterates over the basic blocks
twice in ascending order of their weights. For each basic block all root
instructions are visited sequentially, and for each root instruction the
corresponding instruction tree is traversed recursively. The first pass
allocates registers and keeps track of all registers used. If some registers
remain unused at the end, they are assigned to cache local variables. Then the
process is repeated, using the same framework but this time with code emission
enabled. Debug information is generated as a side effect of code generation.
