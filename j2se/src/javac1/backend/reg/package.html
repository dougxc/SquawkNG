Provides classes for register allocation and spilling. The register allocator
maintains allocated registers, their values and reference counts. If there are
not enough registers during code generation, some values must be spilled on the
stack. The register allocator selects values to be spilled and marks registers
that must not be spilled. Moreover it keeps track of the registers that remain
unused and hence can be assigned to cache local variables in loops.
