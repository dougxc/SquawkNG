Contains classes for the operands of code generation. For each instruction that
generates a result value, an {@link javac1.backend.items.Item} describing the
location of that value is produced. The class {@link javac1.backend.items.HintItem}
specifies for input values what the result should look like.<p>

Note that the class {@link javac1.backend.items.BlockItem} is not derived from
{@link javac1.backend.items.Item}. Its instances do not represent any value but are
used to assign registers for caching of local variables in the loop that the
corresponding block belongs to.
