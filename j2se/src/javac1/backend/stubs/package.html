Provides classes for code stubs. If an operation's implementation can be split
into a common and an uncommon case, the focus is on the common case. Since the
common case will be executed more frequently, it should be the fast path for
performance reasons even at the cost of a more complicated slow path.<p>

Therefore the machine instructions for the common case are directly inlined into
the generated code. If the uncommon case arises sometime, a branch leads to the
slow case, which calls the runtime for example. Its code should be outside the
method's regular code to improve instruction cache usage for the common case.<p>

Code stubs are little out-of-line pieces of code that handle the slow cases of
operations. The code emitter collects all code stubs in a list at first. Only at
the end of the method this list is traversed and the instructions for the stubs
are emitted into the code buffer.
