Provides classes for the compiler interface. The classes {@link javac1.ci.JVM}
and {@link javac1.ci.Runtime1} declare a set of native methods that are linked
to the JVM and registered during start-up. Subclasses of the abstract base class
{@link javac1.ci.Obj} encapsulate an oop to a class, method, symbol or constant
pool, respectively, and use the native methods to retrieve information about the
represented object from the JVM.
