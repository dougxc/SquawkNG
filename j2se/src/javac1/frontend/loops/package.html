Provides classes for loop detection. The {@link javac1.frontend.loops.LoopFinder}
traverses the basic blocks to determine innermost call-free loops in the control
flow graph with regard to a better register allocation. Namely if some registers
remain unused in the basic blocks of the detected loops, they are assigned to
cache the most accessed local variables.
