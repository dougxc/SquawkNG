Provides classes for building and optimizing the control flow graph of a method.
For this purpose the front end iterates over the bytecodes twice. First the
{@link javac1.frontend.BlockListBuilder} only determines the starts of all basic
blocks by examining the destinations of jumps and the successors of conditional
jump instructions. Afterwards the {@link javac1.frontend.GraphBuilder} fills the
gaps between the basic blocks with instructions.<p>

Overlapping with the construction of the intermediate representation, some
inexpensive high-impact optimizations are applied. Each generated instruction is
transformed into its canonical form by the {@link javac1.frontend.Canonicalizer}.
In addition a simple form of value numbering is used, short static or final
methods are inlined, and innermost loops are determined for better register
allocation.<p>

For the sake of debugging, the classes {@link javac1.frontend.BytecodeTracer},
{@link javac1.frontend.BlockPrinter} and {@link javac1.frontend.InstructionPrinter}
can be used to print the initial bytecodes together with their attributes, the
exception table, the resulting control flow graph and the instructions of the
intermediate representation.
