Provides classes for the intermediate representation. The classes and interfaces
of this package are used for building the control flow graph as well as for
register allocation and code generation.

The {@link javac1.ir.InstructionVisitor} interface provides type-based dispatch for
instructions. Functionality that needs to be implemented for all classes is
factored out into a specialised visitor instead of being added to the
instruction classes itself.

Classes that need to iterate over all basic blocks of the control flow graph
simply implement the interface {@link javac1.ir.BlockClosure}. The interface
{@link javac1.ir.ValueClosure} serves for handling or changing the input or stack
values of an instruction.

The {@link javac1.ir.ValueStack} class keeps track both of the most recent
assignment to each local variable and of the values on the expression stack.
