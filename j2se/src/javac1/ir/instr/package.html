Provides classes for the instructions of the intermediate representation. All
instruction nodes are subclasses of the {@link javac1.ir.instr.Instruction} class.
Except for the leaves of the hierarchy, all classes are abstract and serve for
factoring. Some of the instructions, such as {@link javac1.ir.instr.IfOp},
{@link javac1.ir.instr.Intrinsic}, {@link javac1.ir.instr.LoopEnter} and
{@link javac1.ir.instr.LoopExit}, appear only after optimizations.<p>

Each basic block body of the control flow graph is represented by a sequential
single-linked list of instructions. Those lists are always started by an
instance of the class {@link javac1.ir.instr.BlockBegin} and terminated by a
{@link javac1.ir.instr.BlockEnd} instruction, which in turn contains a possibly
empty list of succeeding basic blocks. The root of the control flow graph is an
empty basic block that ends with a {@link javac1.ir.instr.Base} node.<p>

The class {@link javac1.ir.instr.HiWord} is used to fill the second word slot of
long and double values on the operand stack. None of the instructions of one
basic block may refer directly to values in another one, but only to
{@link javac1.ir.instr.Phi} instructions representing them. The purpose of the
remaining classes corresponds directly to the bytecodes with related names.
